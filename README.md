web_scraping_challenge (Module 11)

CONTENTS:

Please find attached the following folders:
Starter_Code

within 'Starter_Code'
mars_news
mars_weather

Please find attached the following files to each folder

mars_news:
part_1_mars_news.ipybn: contains jupyter notebook to answer part 1

mars_weather:
part_2_mars_weather.ipybn: contains jupyter notebook to answer part 2
mars_weather.csv: file consisting of mars weather data, product of running part_2_mars_weather.

NOTES:
The process of extracting the rows from the mars_weather website & appending them to a list was done within the same cell block, not separately as the template states to.
All outputs towards answering the questions directly reflect what was demonstrated within the template. This includes graphs & listed outcomes.
I am mentioning this as it seems obligatory to further support these findings with a separate analysis. However the assignment is already pre-equipped with such, so doing so seems redundant.

Happy grading!
